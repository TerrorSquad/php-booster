# Feature Proposal: Additional Development Tools Integration

This proposal outlines valuable tools that could be added to the PHP Booster integration suite to further enhance PHP projects' quality, maintainability, and development workflow.

## 1. Dependency Management Tools

### Renovate Integration

**Description**: Integrate Renovate bot configuration for automated dependency updates.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Add a default `renovate.json` configuration template to the booster
2. Include customizable options in interactive mode for:
   - Update schedule (e.g., weekly, monthly)
   - Dependency grouping strategies
   - Automerge rules for patch/minor updates
   - Branch naming conventions for dependency PRs

**Example Configuration**:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json",
  "extends": [
    "config:base"
  ],
  "packageRules": [
    {
      "matchUpdateTypes": ["minor", "patch"],
      "matchCurrentVersion": "!/^0/",
      "automerge": true
    },
    {
      "matchDepTypes": ["devDependencies"],
      "groupName": "dev dependencies",
      "schedule": ["every weekend"]
    },
    {
      "matchPackagePatterns": ["^php"],
      "groupName": "PHP dependencies"
    }
  ],
  "timezone": "Europe/Paris",
  "schedule": ["every weekend"],
  "labels": ["dependencies", "renovate"],
  "branchPrefix": "deps/"
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Automated dependency updating with controlled schedule
- Reduced security vulnerabilities through faster patching
- Simplified dependency maintenance
- Customizable to project needs

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "security:check": "composer audit",
    "security:report": "composer audit --format=json > security-report.json"
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:

## Implementation Strategy

To implement these tools effectively in PHP Booster:

1. **Interactive Selection**
   - Extend the interactive mode to allow selection of additional tools
   - Group tools by category (quality, GitHub integration, etc.)
   - Provide clear descriptions of each tool's purpose

2. **Tiered Implementation**
   - **Tier 1**: Essential tools with universal value (Renovate, GitHub Actions)
   - **Tier 2**: Specialized tools for specific needs (Infection PHP, ADRs)
   - **Tier 3**: Advanced tools for mature projects (Custom DDEV, advanced CI)

3. **Configuration Strategy**
   - Default configurations that work out-of-the-box
   - Interactive customization for key settings
   - Documentation for advanced customization

4. **Integration Testing**
   - Extend existing test framework to verify tool integration
   - Provide verification commands to check tool setup
   - Add automated tests for each tool's functionality

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize tools based on community feedback
2. Develop proof-of-concept integrations for top 3 tools
3. Create interactive configuration modules
4. Develop testing strategy for each tool
5. Document integration patterns and best practices

## Conclusion

Adding these tools to PHP Booster would significantly enhance its value proposition as a comprehensive quality tooling layer for PHP projects. The focus on automation, quality control, and development workflow optimization aligns perfectly with PHP Booster's mission to improve PHP development practices.

By providing pre-configured, ready-to-use implementations of these tools, PHP Booster can save teams significant time in project setup and ensure consistent quality practices across projects.
