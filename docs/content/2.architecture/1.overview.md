# Architecture Overview

PHP Booster is designed as an **integration layer** that injects a curated quality tooling stack into existing PHP projects. It is not a project scaffolder but rather a sophisticated tooling enhancer.

## Core Principles

### 1. Idempotency
The booster can be run multiple times on the same project without breaking or duplicating configurations. This ensures safe re-integration and updates.

### 2. Non-Invasive Integration
PHP Booster respects existing project structures and configurations. It:
- Merges rather than overwrites existing configurations
- Detects existing tools and skips duplicate installations
- Preserves project-specific customizations

### 3. Environment Adaptability
The booster automatically detects and adapts to:
- DDEV vs standard environments
- Existing PHP directory structures
- Available tooling configurations

## System Architecture

### Integration Script (`integrate_booster.sh`)

The core integration mechanism that:
1. Clones the booster repository
2. Analyzes the target project structure
3. Merges composer and package.json dependencies
4. Configures tools based on detected PHP directories
5. Sets up Git hooks and CI/CD workflows

### Quality Tools Layer

A comprehensive suite of code quality tools:

- **ECS (Easy Coding Standard)**: Code formatting and style consistency
- **Rector**: Automated refactoring and PHP version upgrades
- **PHPStan**: Static analysis for type safety
- **Psalm**: Additional static analysis for bug detection
- **SonarQube**: Code quality and security analysis

### Git Workflow Layer

Native ZX-based Git hooks providing:
- Commit message validation (Conventional Commits)
- Branch name validation
- Automatic ticket footer appending
- Pre-commit quality checks

All hooks use Google ZX for secure, cross-platform execution with a shared utility library at `tools/git-hooks/shared/utils.mjs`.

### IDE Integration Layer

Pre-configured settings for:
- Visual Studio Code
- PhpStorm
- EditorConfig for universal editor support

### Documentation Layer

- OpenAPI specifications seed
- Docus-based modern documentation site
- Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

```

## Configuration Philosophy

### Merge-First Approach
Rather than overwriting configurations, the booster:
- Detects existing scripts in composer.json and package.json
- Adds missing dependencies without duplicating
- Preserves custom configurations while adding booster defaults

### Dynamic Path Discovery
The booster doesn't assume directory names but discovers them:
- Scans for actual PHP source directories
- Updates tool configurations to match discovered paths
- Adapts to monorepo and non-standard structures

## Deployment & CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Integration
Automatic code fixing workflows that:
- Process changed files on push/PR
- Apply Rector refactoring
- Fix ECS violations
- Create auto-fix commits

### Documentation Deployment
Automated Docus site deployment to GitHub Pages using:
- Nuxt static generation
- GitHub Pages deployment action
- Triggered on docs/ changes

## Extension Points

PHP Booster is designed to be extensible:
- Custom tool configurations can be added
- Interactive mode allows selective tool installation
- Additional workflows can be integrated
- ADRs document major architectural decisions
