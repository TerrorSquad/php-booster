## Initial setup

1. Clone the repository to your own machine
2. Check out the `main` branch
3. Set up the project locally
4. Install composer and node dependencies
5. Ensure you can run the project

## Contributing

1. Pick a ticket from JIRA or Easy Red Mine
2. Create a new branch from `main` (see below)
3. Make your changes:
    1. Code according to our style guidelines (see below).
    2. Test your changes using the integration test script:
       ```bash
       # Run full integration test
       ./tools/internal-test/test-integration.py full
       
       # Or test specific components
       ./tools/internal-test/test-integration.py test-hooks
       ```
    3. Commit your changes: Use conventional commits (see below)
    4. Create a PR and assign it to someone for code review

## Testing Your Changes

Before submitting a pull request, always test your changes:

### Integration Testing

Use the Python integration test script to verify end-to-end functionality:

```bash
# Full test (recommended)
./tools/internal-test/test-integration.py full

# Test only specific parts
./tools/internal-test/test-integration.py integrate  # Test integration
./tools/internal-test/test-integration.py verify    # Test verification  
./tools/internal-test/test-integration.py test-hooks # Test git hooks

# Clean up after testing
./tools/internal-test/test-integration.py clean
```

### Local Development Mode

The test script automatically uses local development mode to test your changes without requiring a Git commit:

```bash
# Your local changes will be tested automatically
./tools/internal-test/test-integration.py full
```

For manual testing, you can also set:
```bash
export BOOSTER_LOCAL_DEV=1
export BOOSTER_LOCAL_PATH="$(pwd)/booster"
```

## Conventions used

This project uses [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). This ensures git history is
clean and readable.

### Branch Naming

Branches must be named in the following format:

`<type>/<prefix>-<ticket_number>-<description>`

Where the prefix can be either `PRJ` (for JIRA tickets) or `ERM` (for Easy RedMine tickets).

#### Examples:
- `feature/PRJ-1234-add-login-feature`
- `fix/ERM-5678-correct-auth-bug`
- `chore/PRJ-9101-update-dependencies`

This naming convention ensures branches are easily identifiable and traceable to their corresponding tasks or issues.

### Commits and commit messages

Commit Size: Aim for small, focused commits that address a single issue or feature
Commit Messages: Follow the Conventional Commits specification

We use Conventional Commits to maintain a clear and informative commit history. This helps us automate changelog
generation, versioning, and other project
management tasks.

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification for clear and consistent commit messages.

Each commit message should adhere to the following format:

#### Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

- type: The type of change (e.g., feat, fix, chore, docs, etc.).
- scope (optional): The scope of the change (e.g., the component or module affected).
- description: A brief description of the change.
- body (optional): A more detailed explanation of the change, if necessary.
- footer(s) (optional): Additional information like breaking changes or issue references (e.g., "BREAKING CHANGE: ..."
  or "Fixes #123").
- **type**: The type of change (e.g., feat, fix, chore, docs).
- **scope** (optional): The area of the codebase affected.
- **description**: A brief summary of the change.
- **body** (optional): Detailed explanation, if needed.
- **footer(s)** (optional): Additional info like breaking changes or issue references.

#### Examples

- `feat: add user authentication`
- `fix(auth): correct password validation error`
- `chore: update dependencies`
- `docs: improve installation instructions`

Commitlint will automatically append the ticket ID to the commit message `footer`. Focus on the title and optionally the body.

## Tools We Use

- We use [ZX](https://google.github.io/zx/) for TypeScript-based git hooks that ensure code quality and commit message standards.
- We use [CommitLint](https://commitlint.js.org/) to validate commit messages follow the Conventional Commits specification.
- We use a pull request template to ensure consistent and informative pull requests.

### Git Hooks Environment Variables

You can customize git hook behavior using environment variables:

```bash
# Skip specific tools during pre-commit
SKIP_ECS=1 git commit -m "feat: new feature"

# Skip entire hook
SKIP_PRECOMMIT=1 git commit -m "feat: new feature"

# Enable verbose logging for debugging
GIT_HOOKS_VERBOSE=1 git commit -m "feat: new feature"

# Skip pre-push checks
SKIP_PREPUSH=1 git push

# Skip specific checks
SKIP_PHPUNIT=1 SKIP_API_DOCS=1 git push
```

For detailed hook documentation, see [Git Hooks](../3.tools/4.git_hooks.md).
