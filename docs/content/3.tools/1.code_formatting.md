# Code Formatting

## Introduction

Maintaining a consistent code style across your PHP project is crucial for readability, maintainability, and collaboration. [EasyCodingStandard (ECS)](https://github.com/easy-coding-standard/easy-coding-standard) is a powerful tool that automates code formatting and helps enforce coding standards, ensuring your codebase remains clean and well-organized.

## Why EasyCodingStandard?

ECS offers several key benefits for PHP developers:

* **Automated Formatting:** ECS automatically formats your code according to predefined rules, saving you time and effort.
* **Customizable Rules:** You have fine-grained control over the coding standards you want to enforce, allowing you to tailor ECS to your project's specific needs.
* **IDE Integration:** ECS integrates seamlessly with popular IDEs, providing real-time feedback and automatic fixes as you code.
* **Git Hooks Integration:** You can easily integrate ECS into your Git hooks to ensure that only properly formatted code is committed.

## Usage

Use the following commands, which are also defined as Composer scripts:

  * To check your code for style violations:
       ```bash
       composer check-cs
       ```
  * To automatically fix many style violations:
       ```bash
       composer fix-cs
       ```

If you're using DDEV, you can run these commands within your DDEV environment:

```bash
ddev composer check-cs
ddev composer fix-cs
```

## Configuration

The `ecs.php` file in your project root is where you configure EasyCodingStandard. This file allows you to define the coding standards you want to enforce, choose specific code sniffers, and customize various settings.
 

## Conclusion

EasyCodingStandard is a valuable tool for maintaining a clean and consistent codebase in your PHP projects. By automating code formatting and enforcing coding standards, ECS saves you time, reduces errors, and promotes collaboration within your team.
