We use [EasyCodingStandard (ECS)](https://github.com/easy-coding-standard/easy-coding-standard) to enforce consistent code style and formatting.

## Usage

Use the following commands, which are also defined as Composer scripts:

::code-group
  ```bash [Standard]
  # Check style
  composer check-cs
  
  # Fix style
  composer fix-cs
  ```

  ```bash [DDEV]
  # Check style
  ddev composer check-cs
  
  # Fix style
  ddev composer fix-cs
  ```
::

## Configuration

The [ecs.php](https://github.com/TerrorSquad/php-booster/blob/main/booster/ecs.php) file in your project root is where you configure EasyCodingStandard. This file allows you to define the coding standards you want to enforce, choose specific code sniffers, and customize various settings.
