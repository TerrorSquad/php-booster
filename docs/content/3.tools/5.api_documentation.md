# API Documentation: Illuminate Your Endpoints with Swagger-PHP and ReDoc

## Introduction

Clear and comprehensive API documentation is essential for effective communication between developers and consumers of your API. In this Blueprint, we utilize Swagger-PHP to annotate your PHP code and ReDoc to generate beautiful, interactive API documentation. 

## Why Swagger-PHP and ReDoc?

* **Swagger-PHP:**  Allows you to describe your API endpoints, parameters, responses, and other details directly within your PHP code using annotations
* **ReDoc:**  Generates stunning, interactive API documentation from your Swagger specification, making it easy for developers to explore and understand your API

## Integrating Swagger-PHP and ReDoc

1. **Annotate Your Code:** 
   * Add Swagger-PHP annotations to your PHP classes, methods, and properties to describe your API endpoints, parameters, responses, and other relevant information
   * Refer to the [Swagger-PHP documentation](https://zircote.github.io/swagger-php/) for detailed instructions on annotation syntax and usage.

2. **Generate the OpenAPI Specification:**
   * The `documentation/api.php` file in your project is responsible for generating the `openapi.yml` file, which contains the OpenAPI specification for your API
   * This file uses Swagger-PHP to scan your annotated code and generate the specification
   * You can trigger the generation process using the following Composer script within your DDEV environment
     ```bash
     ddev composer generate-api-spec
     ```

3. **View Your API Documentation (Optional):**
   * While the `openapi.yml` file itself is machine-readable, you can use tools like ReDoc to generate human-readable, interactive documentation
   * **Note:** ReDoc integration is included in the Blueprint. Check out the `package.json` for the `generate:api-doc:html` script, which uses ReDoc to generate the HTML documentation
   * Refer to the [ReDoc documentation](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc) for more information.

## Git Hooks Integration

The Blueprint's Git hooks are configured to automatically regenerate the API documentation whenever the `openapi.yml` file is modified. This ensures that your documentation stays in sync with your code changes

## Conclusion

Swagger-PHP and ReDoc provide a powerful combination for generating clear, comprehensive, and interactive API documentation. By annotating your code and automating the documentation generation process, you can ensure that your API is well-documented and easy to understand for both internal and external developers.
