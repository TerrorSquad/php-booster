We use [Swagger-PHP](https://zircote.github.io/swagger-php/) for annotations and [ReDoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc) for generating documentation.

## Usage

::steps
  ### Annotate Code
  Add Swagger-PHP annotations to your classes and methods.

  ### Generate Spec
  Run the following command to update [documentation/openapi.yml](https://github.com/TerrorSquad/php-booster/blob/main/booster/documentation/openapi.yml):
  ::code-group
    ```bash [Standard]
    composer generate-api-spec
    ```
    ```bash [DDEV]
    ddev composer generate-api-spec
    ```
  ::

  ### Generate HTML
  Generate the HTML documentation:
  ```bash [Terminal]
  npm run generate:api-doc:html
  ```
::

## Automation

Git hooks automatically regenerate documentation when `openapi.yml` changes.

**Remember:** 

::tip
* Keep your annotations up-to-date as you make changes to your API
* Consider adding ReDoc or another visualization tool to make your API documentation even more accessible and user-friendly
* Use the generated OpenAPI specification to power other API-related tools and workflows.
