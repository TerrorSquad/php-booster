# IDE Configuration: Optimize Your Development Experience

## Introduction

A well-configured IDE (Integrated Development Environment) can significantly boost your productivity and streamline your PHP development workflow. In this Blueprint, we provide recommendations and configurations for two popular IDEs: Visual Studio Code and PHPStorm.

## Visual Studio Code Configuration

The `.vscode` directory in your project root contains configuration files tailored for Visual Studio Code. These files help ensure a consistent development experience across your team and provide essential features like:

* **Recommended Extensions:** The `extensions.json` file lists extensions that enhance PHP development, including:
    * **PHP Intelephense:** Provides advanced code intelligence, such as code completion, parameter hints, and go-to-definition.
    * **PHP Debug:** Enables debugging your PHP code within Vscode.
    * **Other extensions:** Explore the `extensions.json` file to discover other recommended extensions.

* **Workspace Settings:** The `settings.json` file includes project-specific settings, such as:
    * **Formatting:** Configures code formatting rules to match the project's coding standards.
    * **Linting:** Enables linting to catch potential errors and style issues.
    * **Other settings:** Customize various aspects of your Vscode workspace to suit your preferences.

* **Debugging Configuration:** The `launch.json` file defines launch configurations for debugging your PHP code within DDEV. Make sure to adjust the `xdebug.client_port` setting if you've customized it in your `xdebug.ini` file.

## PHPStorm Configuration (Optional)

While the Blueprint primarily focuses on Vscode, you can also configure PHPStorm to work seamlessly with your DDEV project. Here are the key steps:

1. **Set Project Interpreter:**
   * Open your project in PHPStorm.
   * Go to **File** -> **Settings** -> **PHP**.
   * Under **CLI Interpreter**, click the **...** button to add a new interpreter.
   * Select **From Docker, Vagrant, VM, Remote...** and choose **DDEV** as the server.
   * Configure the connection details based on your DDEV setup.

2. **Configure Deployment:**
   * Go to **File** -> **Settings** -> **Build, Execution, Deployment** -> **Deployment**.
   * Add a new deployment configuration and choose **SFTP** as the type.
   * Configure the connection details to point to your DDEV web container.

3. **Install Plugins:**
   * Install the **DDEV Integration** plugin from the JetBrains Marketplace.
   * Consider installing other relevant plugins like **PHPStan**, **Psalm**, and **EasyCodingStandard** for enhanced code quality and analysis.

## Conclusion

By configuring your IDE effectively, you can create a more productive and enjoyable development experience. Whether you prefer Vscode or PHPStorm, the Blueprint provides guidance and recommendations to help you get the most out of your chosen IDE.
