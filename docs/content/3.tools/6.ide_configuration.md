We provide configuration files for **Visual Studio Code** (`.vscode/`) to ensure a consistent development experience.

## Visual Studio Code

*   **Extensions**: `extensions.json` lists recommended extensions (PHP Intelephense, PHP Debug, etc.).
*   **Settings**: `settings.json` configures formatting and linting.
*   **Debugging**: `launch.json` is pre-configured for Xdebug with DDEV.

### DDEV Integration

::steps
  ### Generate Settings
  Run this to configure the correct DDEV container name and path mappings:
  ```bash [Terminal]
  .ddev/scripts/generate-vscode-settings.sh
  ```

  ### Psalm Integration
  The [bin/psalm-ddev](https://github.com/TerrorSquad/php-booster/blob/main/booster/bin/psalm-ddev) wrapper allows the Psalm extension to run inside the container. The generation script handles the necessary symlinks.

## PHPStorm (Optional)

::steps
  ### Interpreter
  Configure CLI Interpreter from Docker/DDEV.

  ### Deployment
  Set up SFTP deployment to the DDEV web container.

  ### Plugins
