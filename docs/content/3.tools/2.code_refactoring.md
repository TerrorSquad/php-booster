# Code Refactoring: Streamline Your Codebase with Rector

## Introduction

Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior. It's essential for maintaining code quality, improving readability, and reducing technical debt. Rector is a powerful tool that automates many common refactoring tasks in PHP projects, making it easier to keep your codebase clean and maintainable. 

## Why Rector?

Rector offers a range of benefits for PHP developers:

* **Automated Refactoring:** Rector automatically applies code transformations based on predefined rules, saving you countless hours of manual refactoring.
* **Instant Upgrades:** Effortlessly upgrade your codebase to newer PHP versions, adopting the latest language features and syntax.
* **Deprecation Handling:** Rector helps you identify and fix deprecated code, ensuring your project remains compatible with future PHP releases
* **Customizable Rules:** You can create your own Rector rules to automate specific refactoring tasks or enforce project-specific coding standards

## Integrating Rector

1. **Require Rector:**
   * Rector is already included as a dev dependency in your project. If you need to update it or add it to a new project, use:
     ```bash
     ddev composer require --dev rector/rector
     ```

2. **Configuration:**
   * The `rector.php` file in your project root is where you configure Rector.  This file allows you to select the Rector sets (collections of rules) you want to apply, define custom rules, and adjust various settings

3. **Running Rector:**
   * **Within DDEV:**  Use the following command, which is also defined as a Composer script:
     ```bash
     ddev rector process 
     ```
   * **Dry Run:** It's highly recommended to perform a dry run first to see the proposed changes without actually modifying your code
     ```bash
     ddev rector process --dry-run 
     ```

## Rector Sets and Custom Rules

* **Rector Sets:** Rector provides pre-defined sets of rules for common refactoring tasks, such as upgrading to a newer PHP version or adopting specific coding standards
* **Custom Rules:** You can create your own Rector rules to automate project-specific refactoring or enforce custom coding conventions

## Conclusion

Rector is an invaluable tool for refactoring your PHP codebase and keeping it clean, efficient, and up-to-date. By automating tedious refactoring tasks, Rector empowers you to focus on building great applications while ensuring your code remains maintainable and adaptable to future changes
