We use [Rector](https://getrector.org/) to automate code refactoring and PHP version upgrades.

## Usage

::warning
**Dry Run:** It's highly recommended to perform a dry run first to see the proposed changes without actually modifying your code.
::

Use the following commands, which are also defined as Composer scripts:

::code-group
  ```bash [Standard]
  # Apply changes
  composer rector process
  
  # Dry run (preview)
  composer rector process --dry-run
  ```

  ```bash [DDEV]
  # Apply changes
  ddev composer rector process
  
  # Dry run (preview)
  ddev composer rector process --dry-run
  ```
::


## Configuration

The [rector.php](https://github.com/TerrorSquad/php-booster/blob/main/booster/rector.php) file in your project root is where you configure Rector. This file allows you to select the Rector sets (collections of rules) you want to apply, define custom rules, and adjust various settings.
