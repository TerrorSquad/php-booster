## Initial setup

1. Clone the repository to your own machine
2. Check out the `main` branch
3. Set up the project locally
4. Install composer and node dependencies
5. Ensure you can run the project

## Contributing

1. Pick a ticket from JIRA or Easy Red Mine
2. Create a new branch from `main` (see below)
3. Make your changes:
    1. Code according to our style guidelines (see below).
    2. Commit your changes: Use conventional commits (see below)
    3. Create a PR and assign it to someone for code review

## Conventions used

This project uses [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). This ensures git history is
clean and readable.

### Branch Naming

Enforced automatically via `validate-branch-name` (see `validate-branch-name.config.cjs`).

Format:
```
<type>/[<ticket-id>-]<description>
```
Where:
* `type` âˆˆ `feature|fix|chore|story|task|bug|sub-task`
* Optional `ticket-id` matches `(PRJ|ERM)-<number>` and when present must be followed by a dash and description parts
* Description: alphanumeric segments separated by single dashes (no leading/trailing/consecutive dashes)
* Skipped branches (not validated): `wip`, `main`, `master`, `develop/test`, `develop/host1`, `develop/host2`

Examples:
* `feature/PRJ-1234-add-login-feature`
* `fix/ERM-5678-correct-auth-bug`
* `chore/update-dependencies`

If the ticket pattern is enabled in config and you use a ticket prefix, it must include the number (e.g. `PRJ-123-...`).

### Commits and commit messages

Commit Size: Aim for small, focused commits that address a single issue or feature
Commit Messages: Follow the Conventional Commits specification

We use Conventional Commits to maintain a clear and informative commit history. This helps us automate changelog
generation, versioning, and other project
management tasks.

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification for clear and consistent commit messages.

Each commit message should adhere to the following format:

#### Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

- type: The type of change (e.g., feat, fix, chore, docs, etc.).
- scope (optional): The scope of the change (e.g., the component or module affected).
- description: A brief description of the change.
- body (optional): A more detailed explanation of the change, if necessary.
- footer(s) (optional): Additional information like breaking changes or issue references (e.g., "BREAKING CHANGE: ..."
  or "Fixes #123").
- **type**: The type of change (e.g., feat, fix, chore, docs).
- **scope** (optional): The area of the codebase affected.
- **description**: A brief summary of the change.
- **body** (optional): Detailed explanation, if needed.
- **footer(s)** (optional): Additional info like breaking changes or issue references.

#### Examples

- `feat: add user authentication`
- `fix(auth): correct password validation error`
- `chore: update dependencies`
- `docs: improve installation instructions`

Commitlint plus the `commit-msg` hook will append the ticket footer automatically (see Hook Footers). Focus on the title and optional body.

### Developer Tooling

Git hooks (managed via Husky) enforce naming, formatting and static analysis:
* `commit-msg`: branch validation, commitlint, ticket footer insertion
* `pre-commit`: PHP lint, Rector, ECS, Deptrac, PHPStan, Psalm (auto-fix where possible)
* `pre-push`: deptrac, tests, API spec & HTML doc generation (conditional)

### Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `pnpm validate:branch` | Validate current (or specified) branch name. |
| `pnpm hooks:test` | Self-test `commit-msg` hook (footer behavior). |

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `BYPASS_PHP_ANALYSIS=1` | Skips PHP static analysis in `pre-commit` (temporary/emergency). |

### Hook Footers

If a ticket is required & detected, the hook appends a footer:
```
Closes: PRJ-123
```
Footer label is configurable via `commitFooterLabel` in `validate-branch-name.config.cjs`. Valid characters: alphanumeric, `_`, `-` (must start with a letter). Default: `Closes`.

### Configuration Reference (`validate-branch-name.config.cjs`)

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `types` | Allowed branch type prefixes. |
| `ticketIdPrefix` | Alternation of allowed ticket prefixes (e.g. `PRJ|ERM`). |
| `ticketNumberPattern` | Numeric pattern for ticket IDs. |
| `namePattern` | Pattern for the descriptive part. |
| `skipped` | Branch names bypassing validation. |
| `commitFooterLabel` | Footer label appended with ticket ID. |

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Branch rejected | Run `pnpm validate:branch` and adjust name. |
| Missing footer | Ensure branch has valid ticket segment & config has prefixes. |
| Slow pre-commit | Temporarily export `BYPASS_PHP_ANALYSIS=1` (avoid committing with unchecked code routinely). |

## Tools We Use

- We use [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) to manage Git hooks. This helps us enforce code quality and commit   message standards.
- We use [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) to ensure that all commit messages follow the Conventional Commits specification.
- We use a pull request template to ensure consistent and informative pull requests.

### Required Visual Studio Code Extensions

To maintain consistency and enhance productivity, we require the following Visual Studio Code extensions:

- [sonarsource.sonarlint-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SonarSource.sonarlint-vscode)
- [usernamehw.errorlens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens)
